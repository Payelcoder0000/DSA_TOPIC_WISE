In Binary Tree, Inorder successor of a node is the next node in Inorder traversal of the Binary Tree. Inorder Successor is NULL for the last node in Inorder traversal. 

In Binary Search Tree, Inorder Successor of an input node can also be defined as the node with the smallest key greater than the key of the input node. So, it is sometimes important to find next node in sorted order.




Solution:


class Solution {
    
    public TreeNode inorderSuccessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {
        
        TreeNode successor = null;
        
        while (root != null) {
            
            if (p.val >= root.val) {
                root = root.right;
            } else {
                successor = root;
                root = root.left;
            }
        }
        
        return successor;
    }
}

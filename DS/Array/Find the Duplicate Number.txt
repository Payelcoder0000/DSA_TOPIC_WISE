Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105
nums.length == n + 1
1 <= nums[i] <= n
All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
 


Solution:

class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int duplicate = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int cur = Math.abs(nums[i]);
            if (nums[cur] < 0) {
                duplicate = cur;
                break;
            }
            nums[cur] *= -1;
        }
        
        // Restore numbers
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
            nums[i] = Math.abs(nums[i]);

        return duplicate;
    }
}

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(n)

Each element is visited at most twice (once in the first loop to find the duplicate and once in the second loop to restore the numbers).

Space Complexity: O(1)

All manipulation is done in place, so no additional storage (barring one variable) is needed.
